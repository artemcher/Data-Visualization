#Diabetes data with web app visualization (Python/Flask)

`python3 data.py`
Plot two features against diabetes occurence.

`python3 fitting.py`
Predict diabetes data using logistic regression/decision tree/random forest classifier.

`python3 visualize.py`
Plot validation data along with the decision boundary of the classifier.

`python3 web_visualization.py` to launch the web app
Once the app is launched, go to "localhost:5000" in your browser to access the GUI.
The functionality of the app includes generation of plots with any combination of two data features and
generation of prediction plots with three different learning methods (logsitic regression, decision tree, random forest). It is also possible to view the documentation of the modules used in 6.1-6.3 by going to the "Help" page in the navigation bar. The application relies on Bootstrap for slightly enhanced user experience.
